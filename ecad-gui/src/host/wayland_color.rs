//! Read-only Wayland `wp_color_management_v1` driver, side-loaded onto
//! winit's `wl_surface` to *inspect* the compositor's color state.
//!
//! winit 0.30 exposes no color-management API but does expose the raw
//! `wl_display` and `wl_surface` C pointers via `raw-window-handle 0.6`.
//! So we open a second `wayland_client::Connection` against winit's
//! display (sharing the libwayland connection via
//! [`Backend::from_foreign_display`]), bind `wp_color_manager_v1`, and
//! read two things: the advertised capabilities, and — via
//! `get_surface_feedback` → `get_preferred` → `get_information` — the
//! compositor's *preferred* image description for the surface (reference
//! white, display peak, preferred encoding). Both are surfaced through
//! [`damascene_core::HostDiagnostics`] for the Color Management showcase page.
//!
//! ## Why read-only
//!
//! We deliberately do **not** attach our own image description. Per the
//! protocol a `wl_surface` has exactly one color-management owner
//! (`get_surface` raises `surface_exists` otherwise), and for an
//! accelerated client that owner is the wgpu/Vulkan WSI (Mesa), which
//! already tags the swapchain — proactively on HDR outputs. Because we
//! *share* winit/Mesa's libwayland connection, a second `get_surface`
//! raises a *connection-fatal* protocol error that takes down the whole
//! app (observed on KDE with HDR enabled). `get_surface_feedback`, by
//! contrast, has no exclusivity rule, so reading is always safe.
//!
//! Driving wide-gamut / HDR *output* compliantly is the WSI's job, steered
//! by the swapchain format we pick: on an HDR output the host selects
//! `Rgba16Float`, which wgpu's Vulkan backend tags as scRGB
//! (`EXTENDED_SRGB_LINEAR_EXT`). The preferred description this driver reads
//! is what gates that choice (`CompositorColorTargets::indicates_hdr`).
//!
//! All entry points return `Option` and degrade quietly to a "no-op"
//! state on non-wayland hosts, compositors that don't advertise the
//! protocol, or any wire failure. Callers treat absence as normal.
//!
//! ## Lifetimes
//!
//! The connection, event queue, and bound proxies stay alive for the
//! manager's lifetime so [`WaylandColorManager::poll`] can observe
//! `preferred_changed` / `preferred_changed2` and re-read the preferred
//! description when the surface moves between outputs or the output's
//! HDR configuration changes. We pass `from_foreign_display` (not
//! `from_owned`), so dropping our Backend does *not* call
//! `wl_display_disconnect` — winit retains ownership. The manager must
//! not outlive winit's display; the host stores it in `Gfx`, which drops
//! before the window.
//!
//! ## Threading
//!
//! `wp_color_management_v1` is bound on a dedicated event queue we create;
//! winit's own dispatch is unaffected. Setup (`try_new`) and a dirty
//! re-read inside `poll` do blocking roundtrips on the calling thread;
//! the steady-state `poll` path is a non-blocking `dispatch_pending` —
//! winit's event loop reads the shared socket and libwayland demuxes
//! events onto our queue.
