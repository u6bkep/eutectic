// ECAD provenance: copied from damascene-winit-wgpu @
// eef1630a198c9c9160f6dc3568eecbc904d76e46 (src/lib.rs) — the same rev
// ecad-gui pins for damascene-core / damascene-wgpu; reference checkout at
// ecad/reference/damascene. Upstream is dual-licensed "MIT OR Apache-2.0",
// Copyright (c) 2026 Christian Balcom; this copy is used under the MIT
// license (upstream LICENSE-MIT). Owning this host is upstream's documented
// intent for apps whose content isn't El-shaped — see
// docs/gui-architecture.md, "Canvas strategy".
//
// Kept as close to verbatim as possible (fidelity over cleanup) so future
// rev bumps diff cleanly against upstream. Local changes are marked with
// `ECAD:` comments:
//   - module embedding (this header, `allow(module_inception)` on the inner
//     `host` module, two `crate::`-path fixes in the submodules);
//   - one owned-canvas seam hook on `WinitWgpuApp`: `raw_window_event`
//     (raw winit event tap; feeds free hover on the owned canvas). Defaults
//     to a no-op; nothing overrides it yet. (A `before_frame` renderer-reach
//     hook shipped with this slice and was removed: its only intended
//     consumer was the pre-owned-canvas camera plan, which is dead — the
//     owned canvas never writes a camera into damascene at all.)

//! Optional desktop host for running [`App`]s against a real `wgpu`
//! surface in a `winit` window.
//!
//! Most native apps should use this crate instead of calling
//! `damascene-wgpu` directly:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use damascene_core::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     let viewport = Rect::new(0.0, 0.0, 720.0, 480.0);
//!     damascene_winit_wgpu::run("My Damascene App", viewport, MyApp::default())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The host owns the event loop, window, device/queue, surface
//! configuration, render pass boundaries, input mapping, IME forwarding,
//! and animation redraw cadence. Your code owns the [`App`]: application
//! state, [`App::build`], [`App::on_event`], optional hotkeys, custom
//! shaders, and theme.
//!
//! [`run`] takes an [`App`] and runs an event loop that:
//!
//! - Calls [`App::build`] on every redraw, applying current hover/press
//!   visuals automatically before paint.
//! - Routes `winit` pointer events through the renderer's hit-tester
//!   and dispatches events back via [`App::on_event`].
//! - Routes Tab/Shift-Tab through focus traversal and Enter/Space/Escape
//!   through keyboard events.
//! - Copies the current Damascene text selection to the native clipboard
//!   on Ctrl/Cmd+C.
//! - Requests a redraw whenever interaction state changes (mouse move,
//!   button down/up) so hover/press visuals are immediate.
//!
//! Use [`run_with_config`] when an app has external live state. Put
//! per-frame state refresh in [`App::before_build`], then pick the
//! redraw driver that matches the data (see the README's meter-class
//! vs event-class discussion): a fixed cadence via
//! [`HostConfig::with_redraw_interval`] for continuously-changing
//! meters, or push-driven wakes via
//! [`HostConfig::with_external_wakeup`] for sparse events, so the
//! idle app renders at 0 fps. For fully custom render-loop
//! integration, bypass this crate and call `damascene_wgpu::Runner`
//! directly.
//!
//! # Environment variables
//!
//! - `DAMASCENE_COLOR_DEBUG=1` — dump the color negotiation to stderr:
//!   the surface formats the WSI advertises, the compositor's
//!   capabilities, the preferred-description targets (reference white,
//!   display peak, `indicates_hdr`), and the swapchain format the
//!   ladder settled on; re-dumped on every `preferred_changed2`
//!   re-negotiation. The first stop for "why didn't I get HDR?" —
//!   see `docs/COLOR_MANAGEMENT.md`. Apps query the same state at
//!   runtime via `HostDiagnostics::hdr_active()`.
